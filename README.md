### Rummage App | Created December 2020


Rummage was my culminating project at BrainStation. Completed from proposal to deployment in 20 days, it was a real test of my emerging skills. I decided to tackle building my own databse, since that was my area of least experience. I focused a lot on getting the look right, a holdover from my design days. I built Rummage using Knex, Bookshelf, and MySQL for the database; Express.js and Node.js for the server; and React, Sass and the Adobe Creative Suite for the frontend.
